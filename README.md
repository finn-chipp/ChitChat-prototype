# ChitChat-prototype
A prototype application that I built to see how I could go about making a basic application using Python sockets when I was first learning them.
To build and test yourself, you will need to install Kivy using pip, and then build a virtualenv for it, since it has remained to be a prototype and I never ended up packaging it.
